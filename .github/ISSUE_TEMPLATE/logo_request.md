Tip: A logo can be displayed by fastfetch without getting into fastfetch's official repo. For highly customized logo for personal use, it's recommended to keep it locally. Please refer to https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/wiki/Migrate-Neofetch-Logo-To-Fastfetch

# OS

Paste content of /etc/os-release and /etc/lsb-release here. If none of these files exist, describe a way to identify the distro

# Ascii

An ASCII logo should not take up too much space (smaller than 50x20 characters). Please also include the color codes if not available in `os-release`
